Welcome!

This was created to help developers find other open source projects.
It is aimed at the Ruby community, but anyone can post an open source
project that they would like help on.


A developer can post a project that they want help with. Project
details should include:
  The Project Name
  A link to the Project 
  A general description
  A simple TODO list
  A link to the creators twitter account (optional)

  Creators email address (required for account creation but optional to be viewed)
  An overview of steps to get involved in the project 
  -- this is an important part, as some newcomers WANT to help but they
     do not have the knowledge (yet) 
    EG:
      # this project uses Ruby 1.9.2-preview3
      # use RVM to help with ruby version management
      # http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/
      # PS: Wayne Seguin rocks!
      # download the project from github
      git clone git@github.com:bcantin/oswm.git
      # install the bundler gem if you do not have it
      gem install bundler
      bundle install
      
      # please look at the TODO list and help out!
